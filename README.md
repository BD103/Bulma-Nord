# Polar-Night-Bulma

Bulma dark-mode swatch using Nord's color palette.

## Contributing

Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BD103/Bulma-Nord.git
```

Make sure you have Nodejs installed. (*Optional*: You may also want some version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for testing.)

Install with:

```shell
npm install
```

The main development workflow entails two instances of shell. One running:

```shell
# Create stylesheet whenever something is changed
npm run watch
# or npm start
```

The other running:

```shell
# Open up an http server
npm run test
# or npm run test-python3
# or npm run test-python2
```

## Replit

Replit is a lot easier. Clone the repo [here](https://replit.com/github/BD103/Bulma-Nord). It should auto-upgrade to Nix.

The run button starts `npm run watch`. I recommend putting `npm run test` in the shell tab.
